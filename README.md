# A Simple Demo project for iOS Geo Targeting

In this tutorial I will show you how to implement geo targeting functionality on iOS. I will describe Appleâ€™s standard method with CLRegion class. Also, I will show you how to test this uncommon feature. We will see how to implement complex tracking logic. Finally, I will describe you how to create your custom regions and explain you why and when custom regions are better than CLRegion. You can use geo targeting to develop a lot of innovative location-based mobile apps.
